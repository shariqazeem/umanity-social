## 1. LANDING PAGE [0:00 - 0:25]

> You're on the landing page. Camera on your face. Speak naturally.

"Hey, so this is Umanity — a social impact network we built on Solana for the Graveyard Hackathon."

> Scroll down slowly past the hero to the 6 resurrection cards

"The idea is simple. Six crypto trends died — Social-Fi, charity tokens, DAOs, NFTs, loyalty programs, and Blinks. We resurrected all six into one working app."

> Keep scrolling to the dark tech stats section (856 lines Rust, 29 Tapestry, etc.)

"Two Anchor programs, eight fifty-six lines of Rust, twenty-nine Tapestry integrations, forty-two API routes, six live Blinks. Let me show you how it all works."

> Scroll back up to the top. Click "Connect Wallet"

---

## 2. ONBOARDING [0:25 - 0:50]

> Phantom popup appears. Approve connection. Onboarding screen loads.

"So when you connect your wallet, you get this onboarding flow."

> Welcome screen shows. Click "Get Started"

"First step — pick your username and display name."

> Type a username and display name. Click Continue.

"Step two — it suggests people to follow. These are real Tapestry profiles on our social graph."

> Select a few people. Click Continue.

"And step three — add your bio. This all gets saved to Tapestry Protocol as your on-chain social identity."

> Type a quick bio. Click "Complete Setup" or finish onboarding.

"And we're in."

## 3. THE FEED [0:50 - 1:15]

> Dashboard loads. Feed tab is active. 3-column layout visible on desktop.

"So this is the main feed. It works like X or Instagram but every post here is tied to real donations."

> Scroll the feed slowly. Point out donation posts.

"You can see people donating to different causes, the amounts, links to verify on Solscan. Everything is public and on-chain."

> Like a post. Open comments on one.

"Likes, comments, all powered by Tapestry Protocol. On the right side you have the leaderboard showing top donors, and recent activity."

> Point to the right sidebar — leaderboard, activity feed

"On the left — our navigation. Feed, Explore, Donate, Govern, Profile."

---

## 4. DONATE [1:15 - 1:45]

> Click "Donate" in the left sidebar

"Let me make a real donation right now."

> Show the 6 charity pools. Point out the escrow info banner.

"Six charity pools — Palestine Red Crescent, Mercy Corps, Edhi Foundation, and more. All funds go to on-chain escrow vaults, not personal wallets."

> Click Donate on a pool. Enter amount or use preset. Phantom popup shows. Sign it.

"Real SOL, real transaction. Let me sign this."

> Transaction confirms. Show success / Solscan link.

"Done. Verified on the blockchain. And if I go back to the feed..."

> Click Feed tab

"My donation auto-posted to the feed. That's the Social-Fi resurrection — giving IS the content."

---

## 5. EXPLORE [1:45 - 1:55]

> Click "Explore" in sidebar

"Explore tab — search for users, discover trending causes, suggested follows. Full social graph."

> Quick scroll, show search bar and suggestions. Don't spend too long here.

---

## 6. GOVERNANCE [1:55 - 2:20]

> Click "Govern" in sidebar

"Now this is where it gets interesting. DAOs died because votes never controlled real money. Here, they do."

> Show the governance panel. Your voting power is visible.

"Every SOL you donate gives you a thousand voting points. You can see my voting power right here."

> Click on a proposal. Show the vote details.

"When a charity pool hits a milestone, a fund-release proposal is auto-created. The community votes on whether to release the escrowed SOL. Your vote literally controls real money in a Solana vault."

> Cast a vote or show an existing one

---

## 7. PROFILE [2:20 - 2:40]

> Click "Profile" in sidebar

"And your profile tracks everything. Impact score, donation streak, how many people you've referred."

> Scroll down to show impact certificates

"These are your impact certificates — resurrected NFTs. Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond. Each one is tied to a real donation, not just a JPEG."

> Show followers/following counts, referral section

"Points, followers, your full social identity — all portable, all on-chain."

---

## 8. CLOSE [2:40 - 2:55]

> Look at camera. Feed or landing page visible behind you.

"So that's Umanity. We took six dead crypto trends — Social-Fi, charity tokens, DAOs, NFTs, loyalty programs, and Blinks — and resurrected all of them into one social impact network on Solana."

> Slight pause. Confident.

"Umanity. Crypto charity, resurrected."

## Tips

- **Don't memorize** — glance at the script, speak in your own words
- **Keep moving** — if something loads slow, just talk through it
- **Be yourself** — you built this, show that energy
- **Target 2:50** — gives you breathing room under 3:00
- **One take is fine** — you can trim pauses in editing
