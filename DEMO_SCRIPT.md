## STEP 1 — THE HOOK [0:00 - 0:15]

> **SCREEN:** Landing page is visible — big "Crypto Charity, Resurrected" hero

**READ:**
"Crypto charity is dead. GoFundMe clones — no transparency. Charity tokens — rug pulls. Donation pages — donate once, forgotten forever."

> **SCREEN:** Slowly scroll down to the 6 Resurrections cards

**READ:**
"We resurrected six dead crypto trends into one working app. This is Umanity."

---

## STEP 2 — CONNECT & ENTER APP [0:15 - 0:30]

> **SCREEN:** Scroll to see the 6 resurrection cards briefly, then scroll back up

**READ:**
"Social-Fi, charity tokens, DAOs, NFTs, loyalty programs, and Blinks — all brought back with real utility."

> **SCREEN:** Click "Connect Wallet" — Phantom opens — approve — app dashboard loads

**READ:**
"Let me show you how it works. Connecting my wallet on Solana Devnet."

---

## STEP 3 — DONATE LIVE [0:30 - 1:00]

> **SCREEN:** Click "Donate" tab. Show the 6 charity pools.

**READ:**
"Six active charity pools. Palestine Red Crescent, Mercy Corps, Edhi Foundation, and more. Let me donate right now."

> **SCREEN:** Click "Donate" on any pool. Enter amount or use preset. Click confirm. Phantom popup appears — SIGN IT.

**READ:**
"Real SOL. Real blockchain transaction. But here's the key — this money doesn't go to anyone's wallet. It goes to an on-chain escrow vault controlled by the community."

> **SCREEN:** Donation confirms. Show the success message / Solscan link.

**READ:**
"Verified on Solscan. Fully transparent."

---

## STEP 4 — SOCIAL FEED [1:00 - 1:30]

> **SCREEN:** Click "Feed" tab. Your donation auto-posted at the top.

**READ:**
"My donation just auto-posted to the social feed. Everyone sees it. This is how we resurrected Social-Fi — your giving IS the content."

> **SCREEN:** Scroll the feed. Like a post. Open comments on a post.

**READ:**
"Likes, comments, follows, Impact Dares where you challenge friends to donate. Twenty-nine Tapestry Protocol integrations powering the entire social layer."

> **SCREEN:** Click "Explore" tab briefly. Show search and suggested follows.

**READ:**
"Full social graph. Follow donors. Discover causes. Social proof drives more giving."

---

## STEP 5 — GOVERNANCE [1:30 - 2:00]

> **SCREEN:** Click "Govern" tab. Show the governance panel with proposals.

**READ:**
"DAOs died because votes meant nothing. On Umanity, every vote controls real escrowed SOL."

> **SCREEN:** Click on a proposal. Show the vote breakdown and details.

**READ:**
"Every donation earns voting power. One SOL equals a thousand points. When a pool hits a milestone, the community votes to release the funds. Your vote moves real money."

> **SCREEN:** Cast a vote or show an existing voted proposal.

**READ:**
"This is governance with real stakes."

---

## STEP 6 — PROFILE & TECH [2:00 - 2:30]

> **SCREEN:** Click "Profile" tab. Show impact score, stats, certificates.

**READ:**
"Every user gets an impact profile. Donation streaks, tiered impact certificates from Bronze to Diamond — soulbound NFTs with actual utility. Points, followers, a portable on-chain identity."

> **SCREEN:** Scroll profile to show NFT certificates and referral section. Then zoom out to show the full 3-column desktop layout.

**READ:**
"Under the hood — two Anchor programs, eight hundred fifty-six lines of Rust, forty-two API routes, six Solana Blinks, and the entire social layer on Tapestry Protocol."

---

## STEP 7 — THE CLOSE [2:30 - 2:50]

> **SCREEN:** Show the landing page OR the feed with the full 3-column layout

**READ:**
"Six dead crypto trends. All resurrected. One app. Real donations. Real governance. Real social proof. All on Solana."

> **SCREEN:** Landing page hero visible. Look at camera.

*Pause one beat. Then:*

"Umanity. Crypto charity, resurrected."

## Recording Tips

1. **Pre-load everything** — visit each tab once before recording so data is cached
2. **Keep Phantom ready** — have it unlocked with devnet SOL so the donation is instant
3. **Face cam energy** — calm, confident, natural. Not hype. Talk like you're showing a friend
4. **Don't rush** — let each screen breathe 1-2 seconds before speaking
5. **If you mess up a line** — just pause, restart that section, edit later
6. **Screen resolution** — record at 1080p minimum, full screen browser
7. **Face cam position** — bottom-right corner or picture-in-picture works great
8. **Total target: 2:45 - 2:55** — leave a few seconds of breathing room under 3:00
